## Git vs. GitHub
 - Git is a system that tracks your changes within Software Development. 
 
    -Pros: 
        
        - Easy to use. Warns you of things such as deleting files (such as trash). 

    -Cons:
    
        - Slow

 - GitHub is a version control platform that allows you to transfer code into the website. It keeps track of your respositories.
 
    -Pros:

        - Visually tracking changes. Able to collaborate with others. Stores codes in the cloud.
        
    -Cons:
        
        - Requires Git.
